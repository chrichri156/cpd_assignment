Short background of the enterprise and their requirements for some IT service

*Love Is All* is a small belgian company that manages a restaurant ("*Vertigo*") and a famous cocktail bar ("*Jalousy*") in Brussels. As they are part of the hotel, restaurant and catering sector, there is a significant need for accessing very quickly their data, in order not only to manage real-time orders, but also to manage their inventory, the orders to their suppliers, and their financial results and their profitability.
Although there are currently lot of platforms that already helps the management of such establishments, those companies still need "one" platform to centralise, real-time, all the others, or basically all the information.


Recommendations for migration of the service to the Cloud

This central system should be a cloud-base ERP platform (Enterprise Resource Planning), such as Oracle, SAP or Growzer (the one that I use during my internship in their company). Indeed, the characteristics of cloud-based ERP platforms are essential for supporting efficiently the management of HoReCa businesses:

Integration: in order to gather all the information in one place, they can be easily integrated with other systems, such as supplier's systems (to allows easy placement of orders, which can be for example automatically sent regarding the low stock of the product/ingredient).
Accessibility: restaurant's businesses often use the cloud-based ERP LightSpeed platform to manage orders (linking the service room to the bar and the kitchen, as well as the cash register). As mentionned above, cloud-based ERP platforms can be linked to others, so does Growzer with LightSpeed. Therefore, on the one hand, it allows the staff to use those platforms anywhere with an internet connection (in the kitchen, the basement, the service room...). On the other hand, the managing team also have access to the real-time informations and results anywhere with an internet connection (in the office, in the building, at home...)
Costs saving: if it wasn't cloud-based, the company would need to invest in expansive hardware and infrastructure to host their ERP platform, or they would need some specific materials to install and use existing ERP platforms.
Besides, as everything is gathered real-time in one place, the managing team can easily use all the information to set up better strategies (for example, which meals are the most/least bought; what should be the price of this item, based on the production costs and the profit margin...), based on the platform's suggestions.
Scalability: as every business has a durability goal, they always want to evolve and to grow. However, when experiencing a growth, everything has to follow it, even IT resources. With cloud-based platforms, this can be done easily.
Operational intelligence


Moreover, in term of cloud computing offerings, HoReCa companies should turn to SaaS solutions (Software as a Service). This is the case with the ERP GROWZER, that Love Is All uses. It is the closest solution to the users (the HoReCa company, the managers and the staff), as they don't have to install or maintain the software on their own computers or servers. They just pay a monthly or annual subscription fee for the access.

However, from the cloud-base ERP platform, or if the HoReCa managers want to create their own platform, they should use a PaaS solution (Platform as a Service), such as Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform.

*Expert Network (to whom the GROWZER team asked for help in developing the platform) chose an MS Azure Cloud-based solution that would check not only the most important boxes in terms of a wide palette of choices but would also provide solid ground for the support of modern platform architecture. Some core functionalities added include menu engineering, cloud-based purchase order system, centralized ordering, app responsiveness as well as stock management. The app was also designed to be operational on a tablet and to be responsive, meaning that it responds to input promptly, without leaving the users hanging.*

This choice for a PaaS solution allows the company to take advantage of the scalability and reliability of a cloud-based infrastructure, while still being able to customise their ERP platform to meet their specific business needs.


Finally, only this last category of client (cloud-base ERP platform builders, or HoReCa managers that want to create their own ERP platform) should use a continuous development strategy, as it refers to a software development approach, that most of the time doesn't concern the HoReCa managers/staff. Continuous development consists of continuously developing and delivering software updates, based on the client/user feedbacks with identified issues that the development can fix. It also allows organisations to respond more quickly to changing business needs and market conditions.
As for the other category, they should turn to SaaS platforms that use a continuous development strategy, so that they can easily notify issues and help developpers to target client, businesses and market expections.
